      <h2>Technical Information</h2>
      <h4>Code base</h4>
      <p>This application was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the TodoMVC framework.</p>

      <h4>The TodoMVC Framework</h4>
      <p>
        MVC stands for Mode-View-Controller and is an acrchitectural pattern thatdivides an application into 3
        seperated entities. The Model component handles all data-related operations. The View component handles the
        render-related tasks and includes elements the user interacts with. the Controller component is the interface
        between Model and Controller component, it handles incoming requests, handles data via the Model component and
        renders the final output using the View component.
      </p>
      <h4>Saving data</h4>
      <p>
        The users data is stored locally in the browsers local storage allowing the app to be used without active
        internet connection.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="setupContent" class="js-content hidden">
      <h2>Set Up</h2>
      <p>Simply download or clone the repository from my <a href="https://github.com/IanCapo/os-project-8"
          target="_blank">github
          repository</a> and open the index.html file in your preferred browser (chrome is recommended).</p>

    <div id="enhanceContent" class="js-content hidden">
      <h2>Project enhancement - finding bugs</h2>
      <h4>AddItem not working</h4>
      <p>Thanks to the Chrome Console I could easily spot a spelling error in the controller.js file on line 9:</p>

      </div>
      <h4>Duplicating of IDs</h4>
      <p>In the store.js in Store.prototype.save on lines 83 - 89 and line 107 an ID for a new todo is
        randomly
        generated. Here I added function that checks whether the new ID has already been assigned to another item and if
        so, generates a new ID.</p>

      <h4>Refactor code from Store.prototype.removeItem</h4>
      <p>In line 160 to 170 I commented out code that was only used to generate a console.log for the developer.</p>

      <h4>Comment out code without function in Store.prototype.removeItem</h4>
      <p>In lines 136 to 144 a variable was assigned a value by looping through an array. My guess is, that this
        variabel was inteded to be used in the adjacent for loop but was not needed. I commented it out. </p>

      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <p>The application has been developed using jasmine testing. It allows the developer to add tests to
        functions in
        order to ensure the code is written properly and that future enhancements do not implicate the existing
        code.
      </p>
      <p>To run the test open the <a href="../jasmine-standalone-3.4.0/SpecRunner.html"
          target="_blank">specRunner.html</a> in the
        jasmine-standalone folder in your preferred browser.
      </p>
      <p>For detailed information on Jasmine checkout their documentation <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/"

      <h4>Overall</h4>
      <p>Using the google chrome devtools and auditing the website these are the overall results:</p>

      <h4>Performance</h4>
      <img src="./images/Screenshot 2019-08-05 at 06.46.35.png" alt="performance">
      <h5>Opportunities</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Render-blockong elements: Elements should, if possible, be loaded at the bottom of the body in order not to
          block the rendering of the
          page.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Accessibility</h4>
      <img src="./images/Screenshot 2019-08-05 at 06.47.59.png" alt="">
      <h5>Opportunities</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Contrast ratio between background and foreground colors: Text is hardly legible. </li>
        <li>Add labels to form elements</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Best Practices</h4>
      <img src="./images/Screenshot 2019-08-05 at 06.49.11.png" alt="">
      <h5>Opportunities</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>HTTPS: The page does not use a secure transfer protocol. This is important to protect users.</li>

      <ul>

        <li>Legible font-sizes: Uses text smaller than 12px. (Application relevant texts are properly sized)</li>
        <li>Target elements too small: Some clickable elements are too small which makes interaction witht the page
          harder.</li>
        <li>Page does not have a meta description. Meta description are displayed in search results and help users find

      <h5>Opportunities</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Next-gen formats: Images, especially icons, can be replaced with smaller image formats such as svg. Google
          recommends
          replacing
          the background image with a next gen image such as webP or jpeg2000. When using those formats one needs to
          make
          sure that browser compatibility is given (e.g. safari does not support webP)</li>
        <li>Render-blockong elements: Elements should, if possible, be loaded at the bottom of the body in order not to

      <h5>Diagnostics</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Font-display CSS feature: Ensures the display of text before the font is completely loaded and replaces a
          standard font once the custom font is loaded.</li>
        <li>Cache elements: Saves elements such as images and files temporarily in order to increase page laod when
          revisiting the page. </li>
      </ul>
      <img src="./images/Screenshot 2019-08-04 at 11.29.49.png" alt="">

      <h4>Accessibility</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Contrast ratio between background and foreground colors: Text is hardly legible. </li>
        <li>IDs of elements should be unique</li>
        <li>Add titles to frame and iframe elements, add alt attributes to images to make it easier for visually
          impaired people to navigate through the page.</li>
        <li>Add a language attribute to the html-tag</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="./images/Screenshot 2019-08-04 at 11.36.39.png" alt="">

      <h4>Best Practices</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>HTTPS: The page does not use a secure transfer protocol. This is important to protect users.</li>
        <li>Avoid document.write()-method to make sure that even user with slow internet connections do not experience
          page load delays.</li>
        <li>Vulnerable third-party scripts: Todolistme uses an old version of jQuery. Always make sure to sue up-to-date
          libraries without any vulnerabilities to
          protect users.
        </li>
      </ul>

      </ul>
      <img src="./images/Screenshot 2019-08-04 at 11.53.47.png" alt="">

      <h4>More potential for better performance and cleaner code </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Inline-JavaScript: Todolistme loads several scripts in the body and also has inline scripts that should be
          combined into one
          js-file and then minified.</li>
        <li>Although todolistme is working on dedicated mobile versions (android and ios) the web app is not repsonsive
          which is very important these days.</li>
